## What are Akan Names?

In Akan culture (predominantly in Ghana and parts of Côte d'Ivoire), children are traditionally named after the **day of the week** they were born. Each day has specific male and female names with deep cultural meanings — representing soul, character, and destiny.

Examples:

| Day       | Male Name   | Female Name | Meaning (Soul / Spirit)     |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Monday    | Kwadwo      | Adwoa       | Peace                       |
| Tuesday   | Kwabena     | Abena       | Tuesday-born / fiery        |
| Wednesday | Kwaku       | Akua        | Messenger / trickster       |
| Thursday  | Yaw         | Yaa         | Fighter / brave             |
| Friday    | Kofi        | Afua        | Birth / fertility           |
| Saturday  | Kwame       | Ama         | Saturday-born / powerful    |
| Sunday    | Kwasi       | Akosua      | Creator / supreme           |
